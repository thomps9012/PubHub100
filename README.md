# PubHub100

The PubHub100 project is an assignment given through Revature where the end goal is to create a digital book library using Java, Eclipse, and Postgres. 
The user should be able to add books, tags, and details about the book in an online database application that can than be accessed later. 

## Stack

The application utilizes Data Access Object (DAO) methods in the Model Viewer Control (MVC) Model, and is a good introduction into data driven web development. Postgres is used for the online database component, along with Java for the server side operations. Hyper text mark up language (HTML) and Custom Styling Sheets (CSS) are used for the front end side of web development. SQL commands are used for the back end of the web application.

## Servlets

Servlets were used to run command prompts from the browser in order to update, publish, and add tags to books. Books were also able to be downloaded to the user's hard drive using a servlet. Lastly books, using the servlet functionality, were able to be queried using book details, such as title, author, etc, as well as the tags associated with each book.

##Conclusion

The PubHub100 project served as a good introduction to Java, postgres, and using the eclipse workspace to code. As a first intro project to Java I learned how to use the DAO methods, servlets, and utilities in order to create a functioning Java web based application.
